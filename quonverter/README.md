# Quonverter

This is the program I always wanted someone to write.  It took me a long time to realise that person was me.

## Write your program in every language

It's a question that comes up often in IT.  Why can't we just take some code in one language and automatically convert it to another.
Everyone agrees that would be great, but then someone points out that a unique language feature can't be converted, and everyone shrugs and moves on.

But it is possible.  The trick is to choose a really simple source langauge, and then you can transpile into anything else.

## Current status

I have no idea what I'm doing but somehow it still works.
